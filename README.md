This repo's files are defunct, best I can tell. If you are a staff member
trying to update the website, you should update the redirect in DreamHost.

If DreamHost's redirect isn't working (make sure to use `curl` to avoid
caching), then you'll want to update the `index.html` file here.

I dislike the redundancy, but a 301 is nicer than a meta tag.
